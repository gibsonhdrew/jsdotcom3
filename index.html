        Jaime Sunwoo is a performance and installation artist from Brooklyn, New York. She builds immersive, sensory storytelling spaces that incorporate sculpture, audio, and video. Often, her works are set in accessible, non-traditional venuesâ€“ a bar, medical office, and a subway station. She creates interactive platforms that evolve through audience engagement, blurring the line between the viewer and performer. Her works are a playful spin on reality, highlighting the absurdity within our daily lives. Jaime Sunwoo received a BA in Art at Yale University. Her work has been exhibited in the DUMBO Arts Festival and site-specific locations throughout New York City.
