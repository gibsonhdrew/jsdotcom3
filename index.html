        Jaime Sunwoo is a Korean-American multidisciplinary artist born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Sunwoo builds immersive, sensory storytelling spaces that incorporate painting, sculpture, audio, and video. Her works are part playful, part tragic, and grapple with our notions of identity, disease, and death. Sunwoo studied art at Yale University, where she wrote and directed <i>Household</i>. Most recently, she directed and produced the interactive radio drama <i>Earshot</i>, which was featured in Culturebot. She is a collaborating artist for Whoop Dee Doo, and appeared on PBS's <i>Art21</i>. Her work has been shown in the DUMBO Arts Festival, Knockdown Center, New York International Fringe Festival, the Bomb Factory in London, and site-specific locations throughout New York City.
